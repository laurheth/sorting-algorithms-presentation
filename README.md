# sorting-algorithms-presentation

A short sequence of demos of various sorting algorithms, sorted from "good" to "bad" via arbitrary metrics (how fun I think they are).

Made as a joke presentation for a Halloween Zoom party with friends. By no means exhaustive, objective, or even particularly accurate. But, I am happy with how the demos turned out, so I wanted to share them.

Note though that they were thrown together in an afternoon, so please consider them to be demonstration purposes only and not something to actually base any production-level code on.
