# sorting-algorithms-presentation

A short sequence of demos of various sorting algorithms, sorted from "good" to "bad" via arbitrary metrics (how fun I think they are).

Made as a joke presentation for a Halloween Zoom party with friends. By no means exhaustive, objective, or even particularly accurate. But, I am happy with how the demos turned out, so I wanted to share them.
